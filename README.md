Imagine a cinematic experience where the lines between comic book panels and the big screen blur, where animation crosses boundaries to create a VISUAL MASTERPIECE.

## SLIDE 2
Welcome to the visual web of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

## SLIDE 3
This Oscar-winning movie CHANGED the animated film industry with its groundbreaking use of 3D and 2D animation.

Let’s explore the visual world of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, its main HERO – MILES with other spider-characters and the main villain Kingpin.

## SLIDE 4
Before I dive into the wonders of it all, I would like to state THE REASON I chose this film as the focus of my bachelor essay. This movie just FASCINATES me! Its visuals storytelling, the characters’ journey, the message that it is showing, the wonderful soundtrack that I listen to daily, and the voice acting is just as amazing as the animation.

As I was doing research for this project, I kept finding more and more captivating information about the whole creative process - I had to choose what things to include. 

So - take this as a summary or an invitation to my bachelor essay.

## SLIDE 5
Starting with the first component of this movie – THE OVERALL VISUAL STYLE - The creators drew inspiration from the classic Marvel comics and so they did with the story.  

The pictures that I have here are the examples of the various inspirations. 

The top left picture is onomatopoeia.

The bottom left is hatching that they used in the movie to shade dark areas. They also used half tones and colour separation to:  first – light an objects within the scene; second – to show depth of field and not use lens blur.

The right column shows the panels of Spider-man’s origin story – the comic itself is in the movie.

## SLIDE 6
In the left picture is another example – THE KIRBI DOTS – named after the characteristic element of Jack Kirbi’s art style.

On the right is the use of the dots in the film.

## SLIDE 7 & 8 

As I mentioned before, the movie takes ideas for the story from the comics.

On the left is the panel in the comic and on the right is the moment in the movie - 

– and so is here. 


## SLIDE 9
As I said before, the movie demonstrates itself as a comic – here each spider-character has their own spider-man volume.

## SLIDE 10
When one of the spider-men is telling his story – the screen splits into comic book panels that are divided by spider webs.

## SLIDE 11
The same technique is used when Miles is overwhelmed - all the sources of noises are huge and popping behind him. 

## SLIDE 12
To increase the stylized look, the animators turned off motion blur in the animation software and used SMEARS instead. This method is used on fast moving objects, mostly in 2D animation by adding extra lines or shapes.

## SLIDE 13
Here is the work behind the method.

In the bigger pictures there are frames from the movie and in the smaller pictures there are screenshots from the software – it is initially what the person who is working on the scene sees.

## SLIDE 14
Here are 9 frames from the movie that showcase a distinguishable visual style. This movie is truly a piece of art – every frame is unique illustration.

## SLIDE 15
First thing that make those illustrations pop are onomatopoeias. It is used to indicate sound and action. All the pictures I have here are frames from the movie except the top left one, which is from the official art book that I own.
