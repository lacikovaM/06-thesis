## SLIDE 1
Imagine a cinematic experience where the lines between comic book panels and the big screen blur, where animation crosses boundaries to create a VISUAL MASTERPIECE.

## SLIDE 2
Welcome to the visual web of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

## SLIDE 3
This Oscar-winning movie CHANGED the animated film industry with its groundbreaking use of 3D and 2D animation.

Let’s explore the visual world of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, its main HERO – MILES with other spider-characters and the main villain Kingpin.

## SLIDE 4
Before I dive into the wonders of it all, I would like to state THE REASON I chose this film as the focus of my bachelor essay. This movie just FASCINATES me! Its visuals storytelling, the characters’ journey, the message that it is showing, the wonderful soundtrack that I listen to daily, and the voice acting is just as amazing as the animation.

As I was doing research for this project, I kept finding more and more captivating information about the whole creative process - I had to choose what things to include. 

So - take this as a summary or an invitation to my bachelor essay.

## SLIDE 5
Starting with the first component of this movie – THE OVERALL VISUAL STYLE - The creators drew inspiration from the classic Marvel comics and so they did with the story.  

The pictures that I have here are the examples of the various inspirations. The top left picture is onomatopoeia. The bottom left is hatching that they used in the movie to shade dark areas. They also used half tones and colour separation to:  first – light an objects within the scene; second – to show depth of field and not use lens blur. The right column shows the panels of Spider-man’s origin story – the comic itself is in the movie.

## SLIDE 6
In the left picture is another example – THE KIRBI DOTS – named after the characteristic element of Jack Kirbi’s art style.

On the right is the use of the dots in the film.

## SLIDE 7 & 8 

As I mentioned before, the movie takes ideas for the story from the comics.

On the left is the panel in the comic and on the right is the moment in the movie - 

– and so is here. 


## SLIDE 9
As I said before, the movie demonstrates itself as a comic – here each spider-character has their own spider-man volume.

## SLIDE 10
When one of the spider-men is telling his story – the screen splits into comic book panels that are divided by spider webs.

## SLIDE 11
The same technique is used when Miles is overwhelmed - all the sources of noises are huge and popping behind him. 

## SLIDE 12
To increase the stylized look, the animators turned off motion blur in the animation software and used SMEARS instead. This method is used on fast moving objects, mostly in 2D animation by adding extra lines or shapes.

## SLIDE 13
Here is the work behind the method.

In the bigger pictures there are frames from the movie and in the smaller pictures there are screenshots from the software – it is initially what the person who is working on the scene sees.

## SLIDE 14
Here are 9 frames from the movie that showcase a distinguishable visual style. This movie is truly a piece of art – every frame is unique illustration.

## SLIDE 15
First thing that make those illustrations pop are onomatopoeias. It is used to indicate sound and action. All the pictures I have here are frames from the movie except the top left one, which is from the official art book that I own.

## SLIDE 16
Second thing that makes the illustration pop is line art on the characters’ 3D models. The artists used a specific software that they trained to create the lines. If this had been drawn manually, it would have required an immense amount of labour. While this could be considered a form of artificial intelligence, in this context, it doesn't replace the artist but actually assists them.

## SLIDE 17
The second component is CHARACTER DESIGN.

Great example is in the picture that I have here. The creators of this movie wanted to amplify the spider design, so the characters together resemble a huge spider. 

Now – let’s see the individual spiders!

## SLIDE 18
Firstly, the protagonist and hero of the movie – Miles Morales.

## SLIDE 19
He dresses casually —hoodies, jeans, and sneakers— making him already a relatable teenager. After Miles gets bitten by radioactive spider - over time, he discovers his unique powers, including invisibility and electricity. As he wants to learn his role as Spider-Man, he starts by buying a cheap merch of the Spider-Man suit for kids, obviously it doesn’t fit him. During this phase he is animated at only 12 frames per second (to be precise each pose is hold for two seconds).

## SLIDE 20
These sketches from the art book are highlighting his journey as a teenager and a superhero.

## SLIDE 21 & 22
**`First is the animation of the slides. `**

A pivotal moment tied to Miles Morales' character development is a famous "Leap of Faith" scene – it symbolizes his confidence as he embraces his identity as Spider-Man. This ties to Miles’s version of Spider-man costume design and the 3D model of the environment he is in.

## SLIDE 23 

Here I have pictures from the creation of the scene and the frames from the movie. 

In left column the first two pictures are the layout in the animation software and the last one is the shot from the movie.

In the middle and right column: it’s what the animators sees and the second are the frames.

Additionally, the script of the scene provides context and dialogue, tying together the visual elements with the narrative.
